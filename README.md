# EZshop - Django E-commerce with Blog

This is a Django-based web application consisting of two main sections: an **E-commerce Store (EZshop)** and a **Blog**. The platform provides a full-featured shopping experience with a catalog of products, order tracking, checkout, and more, while also offering a blogging section to share articles and updates.

## Features

### EZshop (E-commerce):
- **Product Categories**: Browse products by category.

- **Order Tracker**: Track the status of your orders.
- **Checkout**: Place an order by entering personal details.

### Blog:

- **Single Post View**: Read detailed posts.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- **Backend**: Django (Python framework)
